Hello, my name is Lucas, I'm 25 years old, I am an embedded software engineer, working for Actimage GmbH since end of 2020. You can find on my GitHub most of my personnals projects related to embedded. Some are PoC, others are unachieved (yet) projects and others should even work ! And somehow documentated. 😃
